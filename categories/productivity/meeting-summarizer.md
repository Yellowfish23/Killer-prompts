Please provide the following:

2. **Key Discussion Points**: Bullet points of the main topics discussed with the essential information for each (limit to 5-7 most important points)
   
3. **Decisions Made**: Clear list of any decisions or conclusions reached
   
4. **Action Items**: List each task with:
   - The specific action to be taken

   - Deadline (if mentioned)
   - Any resources or dependencies needed
   
5. **Open Questions**: Any unresolved issues that need further discussion

## Examples
When used to summarize a 45-minute product development meeting transcript, the AI produced a clear one-page summary highlighting:
- The decision to postpone a feature launch by two weeks
- Four critical bug fixes needed before beta testing
- Clear action items assigned to team members with deadlines
- Three open questions about integration with a third-party service

## Notes
- Works best with meeting transcripts or detailed notes
- For technical meetings, specify the domain (engineering, marketing, etc.) in the prompt
- Can be adjusted to focus more on decisions or action items as needed
- Particularly valuable for recurring status meetings and cross-functional team meetings
